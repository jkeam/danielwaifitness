      <p>
      I have been a trainer for the past 5 years and it has been one of the most fulfilling and humbling experiences. However my interest in physical health and conditioning has been with me since I was 13 years old. As a typical teenager I was insecure with my size and strength and decided to incorporate exercise and physical fitness into my life and it has been a large part of my life ever since.
      </p>

      <p>
      During college I had majored in Computer Science and a secondary degree in Business and minor in math, but my passion for physical fitness never ceased and I took part in weight training as well as boxing classes. Although my passion was driving me towards physical fitness, logic was pointing me towards full time employment in a corporation.
      </p>

      <p>
      After graduating college I went on to do consulting work for many clients including some Fortune 500 companies. After many years of working in this industry, which consisted of many hours on client sites around the country, nights spent in hotels, hours spent for travelling I made an executive decision for myself and decided to do consulting work out of my home city, the great city of New York.
      </p>

      <p>
      While working locally I decided to give my passion a chance at life and studied and passed my National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM) Certified Personal Trainer test and began applying for part time work and shortly after I was soon hired by one of the top health clubs in Manhattan.
      </p>

      <p>
      For an entire year I balanced both my consulting job and a part time job as a trainer, training clients in the morning, working 9-5 and then training clients at night. Although I was proud of the work I was producing from my consulting job, it was neither fulfilling nor inspiring. However the few hours daily I was spending with my clients that I was training changed my entire outlook on life.
      </p>

      <p>
      To be a point of inspiration, a support system, receiving praise on how I was changing their life for the better left me humbled and in awe. These factors as well as the daily interactions and motivation that was given, not only the motivation I was giving to my clients but the motivation that the clients were giving to me is what ultimately became the deciding factor in pursuing training full time.
      </p>

      <p>

      I quit my full time job and became a full time trainer and have been doing so for the past year and I have not looked back. I have passed my NASM Corrective Exercise Specialist Certification and am now studying for my National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) Certified Strength and Conditioning Specialists (CSCS) certification. Training to me is not just a profession but a labor of love and dedication. I am passionate about the work I do and to me it is truly the most fulfilling and satisfying careers.
      </p>

      <p>
      Now that I feel I have found my passion and purpose I specialize in fitness and lifestyle changes catered to each clientâ€™s goals and needs. Whether its sport specific, overall fitness, or attaining a specific body build I enjoy helping those to achieve those goals in the most enjoyable and creative way possible. I want to continue to be able to help inspire others to be healthy, happy, and perform overall at a higher standard in life.
      </p>

      <p>
      Today, I feel I have found my true calling and that is specializing in fitness and exercise that matches a client's goals, needs, and expectations. Whether it is sport specific, overall fitness, or in attaining a specific body type I will be able to help you achieve your goals in an enjoyable and creative atmosphere. through positive inspiration so that you can live a healthier, happier and energetic life.

				"I have trained with Dan for over a year now, and I can say that I would be extremely hard-pressed to find a better trainer. His knowledge of fitness and nutrition is immense, and he is extremely creative â€“ to this day, he is still coming up with moves that we have never done in the past. As a result, I have seen a ton of progress. In terms of appearance, I am much leaner and have developed noticeable definition throughout my body, particularly in my arms, back and glutesâ€”all areas that I requested to target more. Iâ€™ve also surprised myself at how strong Iâ€™ve gotten â€“ I went from never lifting weights to being able to dead-lift 115 and squat 95 pounds.
            <br>
            <br> Dan also always goes out of his way to accommodate my unpredictable work scheduleâ€”even if that means occasionally coming to train me at 5:30 AM. Finally, he is a great motivator who always manages to push me through the most difficult of sets. All in all, Dan really knows his stuff and makes working out a lot of fun."

				"I've only been training with Dan since February 2014, but I can honestly say its been a life changing experience!  I always had a pretty self-disciplined training program over the years (and there's been a few of those as I'm one of Dan's older clients - something he loves to remind me of), mainly focused on running, with a gym session every week or two. To that end, I've tried a number of trainers in the past but frankly got bored pretty quickly. Prior to meeting Dan, my experience of other trainers is that they expect you to fit in to their training regime with their goals - that can be interesting for bit but soon becomes monotonous. Not so with Dan, who I now look forward to training with twice a week.
				<br>
				<br>
				Dan is a fan of training and his enthusiasm is infectious. Moreover his knowledge and approach is holistic, combining fitness and strength conditioning with nutritional advice if you want it! Most importantly though, Dan sees his profession as a 'people business', and treats his clients accordingly. That means his clients' goals and motivations come first, and the program he designs for them is bespoke to each. He also prides and challenges himself on no two sessions being the same - something which continues to amaze me. When I started training with Dan, my goals were to get stronger, not bulk up, and get a 6 pack by the time I'm 50. Looks like we are achieving this about a year early, but I intend to keep working with him because he's the best in the business I've come across. He's a tough task master no doubt, but above all else its interesting and fun."<br>

			"One word. Amazing! Since my first check in with Dan over a year ago I have been so happy with my results. He really pays attention to my goals and sets up the perfect workout plan to attain them. His knowledge in kinesiology and nutrition really do make him an awesome online coach and I would definitely recommend him to anyone. Although he's states away, he always seems to find a solution to a pain I may be having while working out. Can't express how happy I am with my results thus far, and how excited I am to set new goals."<br>
